This paper is about extracting discrete target detections from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements. We deployed a bottom mounted platformed equipped with an ADCP and split-beam echosounder for validation in the Bay of Fundy. The discrete target counts with ADCP can be used for long-term monitoring of fish presence, particularly useful in tidal channels targetted for in-stream tidal energy development.
