title: "Inverse method applied to autonomous broadband hydroacoustic survey detects higher densities of zooplankton in near-surface aggregations than vessel-based net survey"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'This paper presents the inverse method applied to broadband autonomous acoustic surveys. We conclude the inverse method can improve density estimates of epipelagic organisms by diminishing avoidance biases and increasing the spatio-temporal resolution of ship-based surveys.'
