I am a research scientist at SINTEF Ocean working in ocean obervations and fisheries acoustics. 


Research
------
Sounds travels much better than light underwater. Therefore, we can use sound to see underwater. Sonars can be used to emit sounds waves through the water at different frequency. After a sound wave is reflected off a target (fish, zooplankton, microstuctures) it contains information about the target's properties. In addition, the information varies depending on the frequency of the sound wave. I primarily work towards improving and expanding the way we use active acoustic data. Lately, I have been working on using echosounders (a type of sonar) installed on autonomous ocean-going vehicles to improve our knowledge of the distribution and composition of fish and zooplankton in the ocean. My background is in physical oceanography and acoustical oceanography. I am experienced with programing and I continue pursuing opportunities that requires oceanographic expertise while seeking new challenges.
