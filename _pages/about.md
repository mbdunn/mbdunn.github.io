I am a Ph.D. candidate working in the field of ocean acoustics and fisheries sciences. I have an affinity for programming and a passion for data analysis and visualization. I am interested in applying my knowledge of ocean acoustics and instrumentation to study biodiversity in the Arctic.


Research
------
Sounds travels much better than light underwater. We can use sound to see understand. When a  sound wave that has been reflected off a target (fish, zooplankton, microstuctures) it contains a lot of information about the targets properties. I primarily work improving and expanding the way we use active acoustic data. Lately, I have been working on using acoustics to improve our knowledge of the distribution and composition of fish and zooplankton. However, my background in physical oceanography, acoustical oceanography and programing keeps me interested and pursuing opportunities that require this expertise.
