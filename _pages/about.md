I am a Ph.D. candidate working in the field of ocean acoustics and fisheries sciences. I have an affinity for programming and a passion for data analysis and visualization. I am interested in applying my knowledge of ocean acoustics and instrumentation to study biodiversity in the Arctic.


Research
------
Sounds travels much better than light underwater. Therefore, we can use sound to see underwater. Sonars can be used to emit sounds waved in the water at different frequency. When a sound wave that has been reflected off a target (fish, zooplankton, microstuctures) it contains information about the target's properties. In addition, the information varies depending on the frequency of the sound wave. I primarily work towards improving and expanding the way we use active acoustic data. Lately, I have been working on using echosounders (a type of sonar) installed on autonomous ocean-going vehicles to improve our knowledge of the distribution and composition of fish and zooplankton. My background is in physical oceanography, acoustical oceanography and programing and I continue pursuing opportunities that requires this expertise while also always learning more.
